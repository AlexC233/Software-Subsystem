# ESC204: Praxis IIIâ€”Prototyping Skills Assignment Software Subsystem
This repository contain four files that contributed to our software subsytem's development: 
- `EdgeDetector.py`: a rising edge detector we developed to capture the button input,
- `FSM.py`: a finite state machine which builds off of `EdgeDetector.py`,
- `Rewrite.py`: a re-implementation of the edge detector without using the `countio` module after we discovered issues with signal noise, and
- `Final.py`: the contents of the `code.py` file loaded on our Raspberry Pi Pico.
